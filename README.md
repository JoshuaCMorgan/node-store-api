# store API
We are creating a store API that provides search options for our users. We can search by name, filter based on price amount, and more.

The front-end was not created.  We can handle urls through Postman. But, for reference, here is a working example: https://react-course-comfy-sloth-store.netlify.app/products
In the project, the front-end only makes the http call. And the backend does all the heavy lifting.
